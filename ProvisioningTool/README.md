# Provisioning tool
This directory contains provisioning tool which helps in provisioning 
the secure element by using the APIs exposed by Provision library.
This tool takes the input parameters from json file.

This tool can be built along with aosp build. It has dependency on 
[libjc_common](../HAL/keymaster/Android.bp) and
[libjc_provision](Android.bp).

#### Sample resources for quick testing
Two sample json files are located in this directory with names
[sample_json_cf.txt](sample_json_cf.txt) and and [sample_json_gf.txt](sample_json_gf.txt)
for your reference. Use sample_json_cf.txt for cuttlefish target and use
sample_json_gf.txt for goldfish target. Also the required certificates and
keys can be found in [test_resources](test_resources) directory. Copy the
certificates and the key into the emulator/device filesystem in their respective
paths mentioned in the sample json file.
