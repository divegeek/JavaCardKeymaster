# JavaCardKeymaster HAL

This directory contains the implementation of the Keymaster 4.0
Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) interface, implemented as a Linux
binary which runs as a standalone process mediating between Keystore
(the Keymaster client) and the Applet running on a JavaCard secure
element.
